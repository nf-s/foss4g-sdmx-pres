## Description

SDMX, Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange, is an initiative which aims to standardise and moderninse publishing of statistical data and metadata.

It is sponsored by some of the most important international organisations including the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the European Central Bank (ECB), Eurostat (Statistical Office of the European Union), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the United Nations Statistical Division (UNSD), and the World Bank.

A massive wealth of data is published by these organisations (among others) using SDMX, and is largely untapped by the geospatial web community.

Using TerriaJS, an â€œopen-source framework for web-based geospatial catalogue explorers", I will explore new ways of integrating open statistical data with geospatial data for data discovery, visualisation and analysis
